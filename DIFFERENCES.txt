(Intentional) Differences between JNumeric and CNumeric

* There is no multiarray module.
* umath is a submodule of the Numeric package.
* Ones acts like zeros if no typecode is given instead of defaulting to Int.
* Int refers to native (Int32) int type rather than largest (Int64) type.
* a[0] doesn't work for zeros sized arrays -- use a[()] or a[...].
* Some of the unfuncs that should have been returning ints, returned 
types that matched their arguments (logical_and for example). Also,
some of the documented ufuncs are missing from CNumeric.
* Changed the behaviour of dot. Now dot acts on axis -1/0 by default,
since it now accepts two axes arguments, this is not as big a deal as it once
was.
* Diagonal now takes only one axis argument (diagonal is taken on axis, axis+1).
  I couldn't figure out a way to make sense of using two nonadjacent axes, and the
  python code was broken for axes != (-2,-1) anyway.
* Astype does not make a copy if the type matches the current type. (This matches
  the behaviour of asarray).

(Known differences that should be fixed):

* There are several functions missing that should be added:
  cross_correlate
  sarray
  dump, dumps, load, loads (pickle functions)
  divide_safe, negative, invert, left_shift, right_shift, fmod, hypot, around, sign
